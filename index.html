      Although typically associated with France, a croissant is a buttery,
      flaky, viennoiserie pastry of Austrian origin, named for its historical
      crescent shape
    </h2>
    <h3>
      Croissants and other viennoiserie are made of a layered yeast-leavened
      dough.

      Today, many croissants sold in bakeries and patisseries are baked from
      pre-formed frozen dough. Uncooked croissant dough can also be wrapped
      around any praline, almond paste, or chocolate before it is baked (in the
      last case, it becomes like pain au chocolat, which has a different,
      non-crescent, shape), or sliced to include sweet or savoury fillings. It
      may be flavoured with dried fruit such as sultanas or raisins, or other
      fruits such as apples. In France and Spain, croissants are generally sold
      without filling and eaten without added butter, but sometimes with almond
      filling. In the United States, sweet fillings or toppings are sometimes
      used, and warm croissants may be filled with ham and cheese, or feta
      cheese and spinach. In the Levant, croissants are sold plain or filled
      with chocolate, cheese, almonds, or zaatar. In Germany, croissants are
      sometimes filled with Nutella or persipan; in southern Germany, there is
      also a popular variety of a croissant glazed with lye (Laugencroissant).
      In the German-speaking part of Switzerland, the croissant is typically
      called a Gipfeli; this usually has a crisper crust and is less buttery
      than the French-style croissant.
